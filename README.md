# Rock_Paper_Scissor_game
# 🪨 Stone, 📄 Paper, ✂️ Scissors – Python Terminal Game

This is a simple terminal-based **Stone, Paper, Scissors** game built using Python.

It’s my **first project** as I start learning Python — and it helped me practice:
- Taking user input
- Generating random choices
- Using `if-else` conditions
- Creating basic game logic

## 🎮 How to Play

The game lets the user choose:
- **rock**
- **paper**
- **scissors**

The computer also makes a random choice, and then the winner is decided based on standard rules.

## 💻 How to Run

2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. Run the game in your terminal:
